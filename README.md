# ArrayIterationPlayground

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timholy/ArrayIterationPlayground.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timholy/ArrayIterationPlayground.jl)

This repository doesn't include any/much working code: it's designed as a place to deposit experiments related to generalizing Julia's array iteration API. An issue for general discussion can be found over at https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/15648.

At the time of this writing, this includes attempts at writing a few functions in one or more candidate APIs. If you can "name" your API proposal, consider including that in the file name.
