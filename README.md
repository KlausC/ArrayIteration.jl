# ArrayIterationPlayground

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timholy/ArrayIterationPlayground.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timholy/ArrayIterationPlayground.jl)

This repository was designed as a place to deposit experiments related to generalizing Julia's array iteration API. An issue for general discussion can be found over at https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/15648.  Initial commits tested what it would "feel like" to write code in various APIs. At present, is slowly beginning to accumulate working code. Your best option for learning the current state is to example the tests run by `test/runtests.jl` (including all the files it runs).
